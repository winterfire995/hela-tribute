            <h2>The Story of Henrietta Lacks</h2>
            <p>Born August 1st, 1920, <strong>Henrietta Lacks</strong>was an African American woman unknowingly responsible for providing scientists with the <strong>first immortalized human cell line</strong>. Ms. Lacks underwent treatment for cervical cancer in 1951 at Johns Hopkins Hospital, during which time cells from a biopsied tumor were extracted and utilized to create the cell line known as <strong>HeLa</strong>. She died later the same year at the hospital due to cancer metastasis. At the time, no consent was required for the collection and use of the cells and neither Ms. Lacks nor her family were ever informed or provided compensation. The HeLa cell line went on to be used for medical research, and is <strong>responsible for many breakthrough developments</strong> including that of the polio vaccine. They were also used to study cancer, AIDS, the effects of radiation, clonin, human sensitivity to products, and a variety of other scientific pursuits.</p>

            <p>It wasn't until the early 1970s when cell culture contamination caused a desire for researchers to study familial genetics that Ms Lacks family learned of the use of their loved one's cells in medical research. Since this discovery, the Lacks family and Henrietta's experience have raised important questions regarding <strong>medical rights, the rights to cells and discarded tissue, and privacy</strong></p>
